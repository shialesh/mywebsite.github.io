	<h1>My Course</h1>
	 <h3>Bachelor Of Technology Computer Science And Applied Mathematics</h3>
          <p>1. SYSTEM MANAGEMENT: This course exposes the students to how a computer functions, and how they can manage their own systems. Starting with an Operating Systems installation, dual-OS installation and OS installation on a virtual machine, to knowing Linux commands, writing shell scripts, using tools such as sed and awk, connecting the machine to the network, setting up WiFi, understanding networking, setting up a website, use of Internet tools, cloud based systems, the course covers a vast ground.

             <br><br>
	     2. LINEAR ALGEBRA: This first level math course covers basics of linear algebra including vector spaces, matrix algebra, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, properties of symmetric matrices, positive definite matrices, and SVD.  The course is developed with an aim to provide a strong foundation in linear algebra which will be used in the subsequent curriculum by both CS and ECE students. Time permitting, some applications of linear algebra in engineering disciplines will be introduced. The course also attempts to increase the mathematical maturity of students by introducing proofs and mathematical rigour.   


	     <br><br>
	     3. BASIC ELECTRONICS: Basic components of Electrical Circuits: Fundamental Electrical variables – charge, current, voltage and power; independent voltage and current sources; ideal circuit elements – Resistor, Capacitor and Inductor. Constitutional relationship – Ohms Law. (4)   Basic concepts of Analysis of Resistive Networks: Nodes, Paths and Loops, Kirchoff’s Voltage and Current Laws, Series and Parallel connection of Resistances and division voltage and current. Loop and Node Analysis. (4)   Network Theorems: Thevenin’s Theorem, Norton’s Theorem, Superposition Theorem and Maximum Power Transfer Theorem. (6)   Basic Concepts of Analysis of Networks containing Resistance, Capacitance and Inductance: RC, RL and RLC circuits’ response to Step, Direct and Alternating inputs (including concepts of impedance/admittance, Phasors and Representation) (the response to alternating input will be handled only under steady state condition) (12)   Passive and Active Components: Operational Amplifier – Inverting, Non-Inverting, Integrating and Differentiating configuration (explain virtual ground concept in the process and introduce the term feedback). (8) Diodes: Basic principle, Clipper, Clamper circuits and application, LED, Zener Diode and Solar Cell, Half Wave and Full Wave Rectifiers – Wave form and Ripple & its reduction.
	     <br><br>
	     4. PROGRAMMING: Introduction of Programming is the first programming course in the college curriculum, and aims to bridge the gap between students who have prior coding experience and those who have none. The main goal of this course is to prepare students to understand basic algorithms and data structures, write organized code, and to gain practical experience with debugging, compiling and running programs.   Python is used to introduce imperative programming, data structures, and simple algorithms such as searching and sorting; we also introduce some basic functional programming (map, list comprehensions) and the rudiments of Object-Oriented programming (classes and objects).   At the end of the course the students are expected to be able to work independently in order to develop simple programs of up to several hundred lines, either from scratch or making use of standard libraries, to solve simple algorithmic problems as found in most coding competitions. They should be well prepared for courses in Data Structure and algorithms as well as the Advanced Programming course.
